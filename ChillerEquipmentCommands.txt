#          Command list for ChillerCtrl.py
#
#  This file contains the list of commands for the equipment used in the thermo
#  evaluaion of ATLAS staves.
#
#  The commands are grouped according to each device used in the evaluations.
#  Some commands require a parameter.  The parameter is entered after the command.
#  Format: du : d #c
#				d = single letter for specific device. ex: c for chiller, i for inverter
#           u = user command text.  ex: cSetpoint
#           d = device specific command for action desired by user command.  ex: SP?
#           c = comment about what command does.
