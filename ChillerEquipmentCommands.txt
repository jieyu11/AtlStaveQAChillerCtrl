#          Command list for ChillerCtrl.py
#
#  This file contains the list of commands for the equipment used in the thermo
#  evaluaion of ATLAS staves.
#
#  The commands are grouped according to each device used in the evaluations.
#  Some commands require a parameter.  The parameter is entered after the command.
#
#  [name]  - Name of device (or section) the following commands apply.
#          - SAME name should be used in this config and other config files.
#          -   Whitespace is considered as part of the name
#          -   to be consistent no whitespace should be used in section names!
#  Format: u : d #c
#           u = user command text.  ex: Setpoint
#           d = device specific command for action desired by user command.  ex: SP?
#           c = comment about what command does.

# *** short name for each device facilitating fetching devices commands ***
# *** user type: cStop, meaning Stop under Chiller section              ***
