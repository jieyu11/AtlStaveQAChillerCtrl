#               Configuration of running the chiller 
#
#  [name]  - Name of device (or section) the following commands apply.
#          - SAME name should be used in this config and other config files.
#          -   Whitespace is considered as part of the name
#          -   to be consistent no whitespace should be used in section names!
#  Format: u : d #c
#           u = variable used for running the chiller
#           d = variable value, ex: NLoops : 3 meaning running 3 loops
#           c = comment about what command does.

#  *** Run parameters for the SP Scientific RC211B0 recirculating chiller. ***

NLoops : 2                  # number of loops to run
StartTemperature : 20       # set the Chiller temperature when it just starts
Temperagures : -50,20,55,20 # Temperatures to run through, it stops at the last value when all loops are over
TimePeriod:      1, 1, 1, 1 # The number of minutes Chiller stays at the temperature, e.g. at-50 C, stay 30 min
StopTemperature : 20        # set the Chiller temperature when it stops
StopCoolTime:      1        # The number of minutes Chiller stays after running for the system to cool down

# adding additional loops on top of the default one:
#   - name the section with "Chiller" in it, i.e: "ChillerX01"
#   - with parameters of NLoops, Temperagures and TimePeriod

# #Temperagures : -40,-20,0,10,20,35,20 # Temperatures to run through, it stops at the last value when all loops are over

#  *** Run parameters for boost pump. ***
[Pump]
StartRPM : 10 # the RPM value when the pump starts
RunRPM : 22   # the RPM value when the pump is running for data taking
StopRPM : 10  # the RPM value when the pump stops after running

#  *** Run parameters for the Omega HH314A humidity meter. ***
[Humidity]
StopUpperThreshold :  5 # in per cent, the upper limit of the humidity to STOP the system when running at low temperature
WarnUpperThreshold :  2 # in per cent, the upper limit of the humidity to WARN the system when running at low temperature
Frequency          : 10 # one data point every ? seconds

#  *** Run parameters for the Omega HH147U temperature logger meter. ***
[Thermocouple]
IdxLiquidTemperature :   2 # index representing the Liquid Temperature, possible thermocouple of [0, 3]
LiquidUpperThreshold :  60 # in degree C, the liquid will evaporate at around 70 C, so should keep under that value.
LiquidLowerThreshold : -55 # in degree C, to keep the whole system safe, don't allow the temperature to go too low.
Frequency            :  10 # one data point every ? seconds. Number in range [1, 29] for the current device
DataPerRead          :  29 # number of data points every time user read the device, this number is none changeable
                           # it is defined by the thermocouple device. Only for reference
