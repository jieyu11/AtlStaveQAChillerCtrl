#               Configuration of running the chiller 
#
#  [name]  - Name of device (or section) the following commands apply.
#          - SAME name should be used in this config and other config files.
#          -   Whitespace is considered as part of the name
#          -   to be consistent no whitespace should be used in section names!
#  Format: u : d #c
#           u = variable used for running the chiller
#           d = variable value, ex: NLoops : 3 meaning running 3 loops
#           c = comment about what command does.

[Chiller] 
NLoops : 1                     # number of loops to run
StartTemperature : 20          # set the Chiller temperature when it just starts
Temperatures : -55,40         # Temperatures to run through, it stops at the last value when all loops are over
TimePeriod:   10,5       # The number of minutes Chiller stays at the temperature, e.g. at-50 C, stay 30 min
ToggleState: 1,1             # Toggles the state of the stave bypass. 0 is bypass 1 is stave.
StopTemperature : 20           # set the Chiller temperature when it stops
StopCoolTime:      1           # The number of minutes Chiller stays after running for the system to cool down

#  *** Run parameters for boost pump. ***
[Pump]
StartRPS : 10 # the RPS value when the pump starts
RunRPS : 10   # the RPS value when the pump is running for data taking: Used if bolAutoFlow = False and initial value for bolAutoFlow = True
RunLPM : 1    # the LPM value when the pump is running for data taking: Used if bolAutoFlow = True
StopRPS : 10  # the RPS value when the pump stops after running

#  *** Run parameters for the Omega HH314A humidity meter. ***
[Humidity]
StopUpperThreshold :  5 # in per cent, the upper limit of the humidity to STOP the system when running at low temperature
WarnUpperThreshold :  2 # in per cent, the upper limit of the humidity to WARN the system when running at low temperature
Frequency          : 30 # one data point every ? seconds

#  *** Run parameters for the Omega HH147U temperature logger meter. ***
[Thermocouple]
IdxLiquidTemperature :   2 # index representing the Liquid Temperature, possible thermocouple of [0, 3]
LiquidUpperThreshold :  60 # in degree C, the liquid will evaporate at around 70 C, so should keep under that value.
LiquidLowerThreshold : -55 # in degree C, to keep the whole system safe, don't allow the temperature to go too low.
Frequency            :  29 # one data point every ? seconds. Number in range [1, 29] for the current device
DataPerRead          :  29 # number of data points every time user read the device, this number is none changeable
                           # it is defined by the thermocouple device. Only for reference
