#	Configuration file for ChillerCtrl.py.
#
#  This file conains all the desired configuration settings for the equipment
#  used in the thermo evaluation of the ATLAS stave quality assurance process.
#  Each piece of equipment communicates with the controlling computer via a 
#  serial port, either the RS-232 or USB port(s).  The protocal for these ports
#  should be set to match the protocal of each equipment.
#
#  This file format:
#  [name]     - Name of device the following commands apply.
#             - SAME name should be used in this config and other config files.
#             -   Whitespace is considered as part of the name
#             -   to be consistent no whitespace should be used in section names!
#  CMD[=value][#...] - Command for device followed with optional value & comment.
